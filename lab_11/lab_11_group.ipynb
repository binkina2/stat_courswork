    "Suppose that a Calculus student is curious about the proportion of former Calculus students that got A's in the class that they are currently enrolled in (taught by Dr. Difficult). This class has had thousands of students enrolled in the past. The student collects a random sample of 40 former students who have taken the class and asks them if they got an A in the class (or not). 60% of the students in the sample got an A.\n",

The student would like to determine if there is evidence to suggest that the proportion of ALL students who have taken Dr. Difficult's class that get A's is *different* than the the proportion of ALL students who have taken Dr. Eezee's class that get A's.\n",
